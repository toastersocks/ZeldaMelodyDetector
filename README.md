# Melody Detector #

## Listens for a melody and activates a trigger when the correct one is heard ##

Listening and note identification happens on a Raspberry Pi Using [Pure Data](https://puredata.info). The notes are then sent to an Arduino for melody identification and triggering.

Currently setup to detect melodies from Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but could work with any melody.
